      If HTML, CSS and JavaScript were parts of a house, HTML would be the
      blueprint - it lays out the foundations, walls, rooms ect. Then CSS is
      like the interior design - it specifies the color of the walls, picks out
      the furniture, sets the lighting, ect. JavaScript is like the electricity,
      it makes things happen - the lights turning on, the doorbell ringing when
      someone's at the door, ect. On a website, JavaScript is the code
      responsible for functionality and responsiveness, like letting you submit
      a form by clicking a button.

    <p><strong>Control Flow and Loops</strong></p>
    <p>
      Now we move on to control flow and loops. Say you're cooking your favorite
      dish. The control flow would be the recipe you're following: "do task 1,
      then task 2, ect." A loop is when you need to do a thing repeatedly, like
      stirring a pot ten times. Instead of saying "stir, stir, stir..." ten
      times, you can say "stir ten times". It's a shorter to to repeat something
      than explicitly writing out the same thing that many times.

    <p><strong>The DOM (Document Object Model)</strong></p>
    <p>
      The DOM, or Document Object Model is like a model version of your
      website that you can play around with. It's a model that the browser uses
      to represent a website. You can use JavaScript to tweak it, like changing text, 
      or switching the color of a button when it's clicked.

    <p><strong>Arrays and Objects</strong></p>
    <p>
    Arrays and objects are two ways to store information. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An array is just like a list. 
      You can find what you've stored by the lists number. So if
      you've left a string in list position 3, you go to that position to fetch
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      However an object behaves more like a box with labeled
      compartments. If you've put your data in the 'book' compartment, that's
      where you find it when you need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for arrays, you use numbers (indexes) to find your data. 
      For objects, you use names (keys).
    </p>

    <br />
    <p><strong>Functions</strong></p>
    <p>
      Finally, functions. Each function is a piece of code that carries out 
      a pre-defined task. You write it once, then call it over and over 
      whenever you need it. It keeps your code tidy, and it saves you a lot 
      of repeating yourself.
