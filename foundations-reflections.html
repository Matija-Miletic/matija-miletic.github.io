    <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Firstly, I have learned that I am capable of consistent and focused
      attention, even though my ADHD can pose challenges. Through structured
      learning, I found ways to direct my attention productively. Secondly, I
      realized the extent to which I value the application of ethics and empathy
      in my work. This revelation has led me to approach my tasks and
      interactions with a deeper consideration for their potential impact.
      Lastly, I have discovered the benefits of letting go of ego, especially
      when working on complex programming tasks. The core learning has taught me
      to separate my identity from the code I write, helping me ask for help
      earlier and more often.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Values guide our decision-making process, affecting the choices we make in
      coding and collaboration. They help us uphold ethical standards, making us
      responsible programmers. Empathy is crucial in creating user friendly
      designs and solutions, as it allows us to understand and cater to the
      needs of the end users. It also fosters a better team environment, leading
      to productive collaborations. Self-awareness is essential for continuous
      personal and professional development. Being aware of our strengths and
      limitations allows us to strategically navigate learning and tackle
      challenges in programming.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      What surprised me the most was the strong emphasis on self-reflection and
      mindfulness. Initially, I assumed that a technical field like programming
      would focus almost entirely on hard skills. However, I was pleasantly
      surprised to find that soft skills like communication, collaboration, and
      introspection were considered equally important in this journey.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      One of the most challenging aspects was managing my ego when faced with
      complex problems. Detaching my self-worth from my work was difficult but
      crucial for my personal and professional growth. Additionally, finding a
      balance between striving for perfection and acknowledging when my work is
      good enough posed a significant challenge due to my tendency to be overly
      critical of my own work.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Focusing on core learning encourages the holistic development of a
      programmer. While technical skills are essential, soft skills such as
      empathy, collaboration, self-awareness, and adaptability are equally
      important in the real world. By emphasizing core learning, Dev Academy
      ensures that we not only have the hard skills to tackle complex
      programming tasks but also the human skills to collaborate in teams, adapt
      to new environments, and engage empathetically with end users.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      The time spent studying core learning certainly does not feel like a
      waste. It has been an investment in developing a well-rounded skill set.
      While practicing programming is obviously crucial, understanding the
      impact of our work, developing the ability to collaborate effectively, and
      learning how to manage ourselves are equally important. These skills help
      create a well rounded programmer, one who can not only write code but also
      navigate the complexities of the programming world.
