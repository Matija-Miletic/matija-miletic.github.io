      <h2>Reflections on The Self</h2>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <h3>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h3>
    <p>
      On a trip to the west coast, i found a wallet on the ground. I dropped the
      wallet off at the nearby i-site. When the owner returned he was very
      relieved and thankful. Returning the wallet was the obvious thing to do as
      i value honesty and kindness. Upon reflection i am glad that my actions
      align with my values.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I come from a Serbian family, but grew up in NZ. This mix of cultures
      greatly influenced my identity and values. I was taught to be open-minded,
      tolerant, and respectful of all cultures and beliefs. My parents
      emphasized the importance of education, hard work, and perseverance from a
      young age. The people around me, like my friends and teachers, also shaped
      my values by encouraging collaboration and empathy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of my significant strengths is adaptability. I can quickly adjust to
      new environments, which is beneficial in a learning setting, where
      classes, methods, and technologies frequently change. I am also a
      self-motivated individual, meaning I can set goals for myself and work
      diligently towards them. Additionally, I possess good communication
      skills, which are helpful in group projects and presentations.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of my main limitations is that I tend to procrastinate, especially
      when I am not particularly excited about the task at hand. This can affect
      my learning journey by causing delays and stress as deadlines approach. To
      mitigate this, I have started using the Pomodoro Technique, which involves
      working for a set amount of time, then taking a short break. Another
      limitation is that I can be overly critical of my own work, which
      sometimes hinders my progress. I am working on finding a balance between
      striving for perfection and acknowledging when my work is good enough.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In a group project last semester, there was a member who was not
      contributing equally. Initially, I tried to subtly remind them of their
      responsibilities, but the situation didn't change. Then, I decided to have
      an open conversation about it, expressing the group's concerns while
      trying to understand their perspective. This helped to some extent, as the
      team member started to contribute more. Reflecting on this, I feel I
      should have addressed the situation sooner and more directly to prevent
      tension from building. In the future, I would set clear expectations for
      all group members from the outset and address any issues promptly.
